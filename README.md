# My-Bot
This is a chat spam bot that will spam a chat box with a single phrase or with random phrases.

I DO NOT CONDONE USE OF THIS BOT FOR MALICIOUS PURPOSES. THIS PROJECT WAS CREATED WITH LEARNING IN MIND, AND I ONLY RECOMMEND USE FOR THAT PURPOSE.

The only nonstandard modules this bot requires are pywin32, and pyautogui. Please support these developers!
pywin32: https://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/
pyautogui: https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Follow the prompts given in the shell, and when it says "click to begin", click the location of the chat box you would like to spam.

I plan to add a GUI and to create an executable file (.exe) that will act as the bot as well.

Please let me know if you have any questions, issues, or potential changes to add.
